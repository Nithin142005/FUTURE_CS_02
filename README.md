# FUTURE_CS_02 - Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response

## 🔍 Project Overview
This repository documents a cybersecurity intern-led SOC analysis using Elastic Stack (Kibana, Elasticsearch, Logstash) and Kali Linux. It includes threat detection, incident response, and remediation strategies mapped to OWASP Top 10.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Elastic Stack (Kibana, Elasticsearch)
- Kali Linux
- Sample Log Files
- MS Word (for reporting)

## 📊 Key Features
- Real-time log analysis via Kibana Discover
- Detection of malware (Trojan, Rootkit)
- Login failure tracking and brute-force detection
- Connection attempt monitoring
- Alert severity classification
